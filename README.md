# Tic-Tac-Toe in Jetpack Compose

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Jetpack Compose for Android. This project showcases how to use Jetpack Compose to build a responsive and modern Android UI with minimal code. The game allows two players to play on the same device, offering a fun way to demonstrate state management and UI building in Jetpack Compose.

## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend on the same device.
- **Interactive UI**: Players tap on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
- **Game Status**: The app displays the current player's turn and the winner once the game is over.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Clean Architecture**: The game follows a simple architecture pattern with clear separation between UI and logic.

## Tech Stack
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI framework for building modern Android apps.
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used.
- **State Management**: Utilize Compose’s state management (e.g., `remember`, `mutableStateOf`) to handle the game state.
- **Material Design**: Use of Material Design components to enhance the UI and provide a consistent design.
